Bloxorz Game!
Bloxorz is a 3-D block sliding puzzle game consists of a terrain that is built
by 1×1 tile with a special shape and size, and a 1×1×2 size block. This game is a
single agent path-finding problem that involves moving the block from its initial
position using four directions (right, left, up, and down) and ensuring that its ends
are always within the terrain boundary, until it falls into a 1×1 square hole in the
terrain that represents our goal state.
The block can be in three states, standing, lying horizontally, and lying
vertically. When the block reaches the hole, it must be in standing state to fall in it.
The level-1 of the game begins with the size of the terrain as 6×10 rows and
columns, starting position is at row 2 and column 2 or as user determines it, and
goal position is at row 5 and column 8.
